# Welcome to the *glikonal* repository!
This code computes the minimal altitude for an unpowered aircraft to return to an airfield.
It also computes the paths to follow for a safe re-entry.
The code is mainly built on top of the *pykonal* library available [here](https://github.com/malcolmw/pykonal).
This code implements the Fast Marching Method (FMM; Sethian *et al.*, 1996) for solving the eikonal equation in Cartesian or spherical coordinates in 2 or 3 dimensions.


## Installation

Download and unzip the [latest release](https://github.com/giovannipiccioli/glikonal/releases "Releases").
Then in the terminal execute
```bash
 cd path/to/glikonal
 pip install .
```

## Tutorials
The folder "gliding_distance" contains two jupyter notebooks that explain how to use the library.
### Artificial data
To better understand how the algorithm works one can start from artificial examples. In the notebook "examples_min_return_altitude", we look at the case of no terrain, a single mountain peak and a mountain range with two saddles.

This notebook goes though these various examples fo elevation profile, to show how glikonal computes the minimal altitude for re-entry and the re-entry paths.
Let us provide some pictures of this below.
For an elevation profile with a single peak, and glide ratio of 1, we can plot the minimal altitude contour lines (in white), on top of the elevation map (color indicates elevation).
